				<h2>About Michael Rose</h2>
				<h3>This is a site that is in progress....</h3>
				<p>In another life, I was working at Packard Bell/NEC customer service.  I had gotten tired of the corporate life, and wanted a change.
					That is when I decided to change my career.</p>
				<p>I'm a truck driver by trade.  In 2019 I had decided that it was time for me to own my own business.  For 10 months I was 
				purchasing my own truck and leasing back to KMB Brothers.  The engine blew and I couldn't afford to fix it.</p>
				<p>After that catastrophe, I had become unemployed for a couple of months.  I had attempted to get a loan to either
					fix my truck or get another one.  However, I didn't have any savings and didn't have a down payment.</p>
				<p>While I was attempting to save my business, I had continued looking for work.  I was doing some temporary work
					and even washed some dishes.  Eventually, I had found Sunrise Express, a trucking company out of Nebraska.  They would
					allow me to keep my newly aquired puppy dog Nuvo.</p>
				<p>Even though I was up and running again, I wanted to save my business.  I was doing research on Web Development and decided
					that I would give it a try.</p>
				<p>And that is my story.  Right now I'm working on this site and still learning.  I can bring a whole new perspective to the 
					industry.  I have worked various manual labor jobs in the past.  With the experience that I have with computers, I'll bring 
					a new perspective to the business.</p>
