    <h2>Blog Post #1</h2>
    <h3>January 31, 2020</h3>
    <p>Right now I'm in Grand Island, Nebraska at the Sunrise Express terminal.  I'm currently doing my 34 hour restart here,
        and waiting for a load out of here.  I might get a chance to go home to Draper, Utah soon.  However, I just might end 
        up going back out again for another week.</p>
    <p>I'm so glad that I have found Sunrise Express, and driving for them.  There is a lot of paperwork involved with this job
        but they seem to have their heads together.  I also love how they embrace technology in helping us drive.  Sure it is 
        a little bit more work, but I can count on getting things done as well.</p>
    <p>What had surprised me the most was their maintenance program.  As I was pulling into the terminal, I got a call about 
        bringing my truck in. I just had it serviced about 4 weeks ago.  Turns out that they service their trucks every 4 weeks. 
        Even though this is expensive, it means that I won't have a breakdown.  As they said in mechanic school, "pay me now or later"</p>
    <p>Now on to the programing part.  I'm using git as a way to keep things organized.  For right now, I'm going to have to "hardcode"
        my blogs in.  However, I'm going to use PHP to make it easier and make the site more dynamic.  It is going to be a long process so standby 
        to standby.  Shouldn't take too long....once I learn php.</p>

    <h3>Febuary 1, 2020</h3>
    <p>Right now it is 7am and it is the second.  I've gotten a load back to Salt Lake that delivers tomorrow early.  That means that I'll be able
        to post another one early in the morning.  That will of course be on the 3rd...</p>
    <p>I'm stuck up here in Evanston, Wyoming waiting for a chance to get out of here.  I'm stuck with a bunch of Eastbound drivers, and the road is closed. 
        I managed to find a place to park where other drivers will block you off, until the road opens. There may be a way for me to get out of here, but it 
        is going to be tight.</p>
    <p>I've have gotten my routines back up and running on Trello.  I had them there before and it worked somewhat good.  However, I'm going to exercise my programming 
        skill and write a program for them.  However, time is money and I need to have them going.  For now, I'm going to use Trello, until I'm done with it.</p>
    <h3>February 3, 2020</h3>
    <p>Well, I've delivered and I'm home here in Salt Lake City Ut.  There was a nasty snow storm last night, and the roads are closed both ways.   That's when it was 
        decided that I would stay home.  I only had 6 hours left on my 14 hour clock anyway, and the roads are closed both ways.  Tomorrow will be a better time
        to get a load and make some more money.</p>
    <p>I've gotten some good reviews about my website so far.  I would really like to get some opinions about it.  Please leave a comment or two on my facebook page.  
        Here is a link to my page.</p>

    <p>My next few updates aren't going to be anything special.  I'm going to add some PHP stuff, and maybe some database stuff. I'm also going to get some personal programs
        written.  I'm also going to get a contact page written and going.  I'm looking forward to it.</p>
    <h3>February 11, 2020</h3>
    <p>I have seemed to stall on this little "project" of mine.  I wanted to make some changes to the "nuts and bolts" of the website. First, I put the header, menu, and the 
        footer into their own php files.  Then I had to update the post page to get them all to work right.  That took up all of the time.</p>
    <p>Of course it took a couple of hours to find that a pair of quotation marks were causing a lot of my problems.  One of the risks that you have with programing.  However, 
        it seems to be working now.  Even though there aren't changes on the site, believe me when I say that there is.</p>
    <p>What is next is to make this more Object Oriented, or OOP.  However, that is going to take some time to get running.  I might have to wait on that.  Don't know for sure on
        that one.  Who knows?</p>
    <p>What I need to do is to put these posts into a database. Then I could allow you to check and pull down from it.  That is going to take some time as well, but should
        be what is next.</p>
    <p>On the trucking side, I actually got to throw some chains on.  I put on 4, ended up losing 2 and breaking 2.  I also had to get some new mudflaps replaced as well as
        other things.  For my first time though, I didn't think it was that bad.  Just have to remember to go slower....</p>
