    <h2>Blog Post #1</h2>
    <h3>January 31, 2020</h3>
    <p>Right now I'm in Grand Island, Nebraska at the Sunrise Express terminal.  I'm currently doing my 34 hour restart here,
        and waiting for a load out of here.  I might get a chance to go home to Draper, Utah soon.  However, I just might end 
        up going back out again for another week.</p>
    <p>I'm so glad that I have found Sunrise Express, and driving for them.  There is a lot of paperwork involved with this job
        but they seem to have their heads together.  I also love how they embrace technology in helping us drive.  Sure it is 
        a little bit more work, but I can count on getting things done as well.</p>
    <p>What had surprised me the most was their maintenance program.  As I was pulling into the terminal, I got a call about 
        bringing my truck in. I just had it serviced about 4 weeks ago.  Turns out that they service their trucks every 4 weeks. 
        Even though this is expensive, it means that I won't have a breakdown.  As they said in mechanic school, "pay me now or later"</p>
    <p>Now on to the programing part.  I'm using git as a way to keep things organized.  For right now, I'm going to have to "hardcode"
        my blogs in.  However, I'm going to use PHP to make it easier and make the site more dynamic.  It is going to be a long process so standby 
        to standby.  Shouldn't take too long....once I learn php.</p>
