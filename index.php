		<h2>My Blog</h2>
		<h3>This is a site that is in progress....</h3>
		<p>I'm currently staging a new business in Web development.  I plan on going live with it in 6 months where I'll be doing web development for people.  My services are going to include web site development, app development and management.</p>
		<p>However, until then, I'm going to start a blog that is going to detail my journey into this world.  I'm also hoping to show off some of my projects as well.</p>
		<p>Get in, sit down, fasten your seatbelts, and keep your arms and hands inside at all times. Let's enjoy this together.....</p>
